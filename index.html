				Hola, ¿Cómo están, mis amigos?<br> 
				This is an introduction about me. To cut this short, for every single paragraph of an introduction section,  someone in the past, present or even in the future is considered as the target reader. For those in our past memory, we only want to make them feel proud or regret (if they dump us somewhere in the past) by showing off our recent success. To the most recent friends, this however might sound daunting or over-explaining. For those in my future, yeah this introduction page is just targeting you here. 	So, that is to you my future follower or stalker.<br>
				<br>
			<p style="color: grey;">
				I strongly hope you find my name somewhere in a meaningful work which pushed you to search for my name to know who I'm and what  my educational or professional background is. I think I should be blessed to have such thing if that's dragging you here. I'm saying this since to many in my real life, I'm the kindest, smartest, coolest and to others it's quite opposite.  They are treating me in a way to prove their own theories on me; they are not actually seeking the truth about me. So, if I'm dragging you here based on that work or output, I'm the luckiest since I have a guest here today who is here to prove his most positive theories on me.

				By that in my mind, BTW,  
				I'm Sobhʌn,  a netizen living on the internet for over two decades and like anyone else walking on this planet and fighting battles you are not aware of.

			Reading about tech in general (and AI these days) is my absolute joy and living in a world occupied fully by robots is my Roman Empire which I'm thinking about sometimes all day long. In addition to it, I would like to spend my time reading about the matter of evolution from physics perspectives and come up with a differentiable solutions where we can enforce it to follow some behavior during evolution process. From the angle I see it, it's a 3D data analysis and visualization where computers can learn them, teach them, render them and giving us insights about these phenomena.
			<br>
					Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Otago and Canterbury, NZ, working with professor Brendan McCane and Holger Regenbrekht. My focus lies in Human computer interaction (HCI) where I'm geting digital 3D objects off their digital base and blowing a soul into them and make them real life objects.  The output shapes can be used in prototypings, catalytic beds, filters, chromatographic media, Heat Exchangers and so on.
					<br>
					The mentioned geometries can be used in conjunction with other chemical or physical phenomena to boost the existing tools and applications. 
					 Before joining Otago, I worked on Robot design and planning in 2014 at LAVAN. In 2015 I started studying computer vision alogorithm and worked on star-based navigation systems.  I completed my master studies with the focus on derivative- and integral-free methods (matrix computations) to avoid derivative or integral operations in engineering and neruoscience applications and computations. I was lucky and honored to work with my mentors, prof. Delkhosh and prof. Mohades in Computer Science schools at Shahid Beheshti and Amir Kabir universities. 

<br>
In 2018, I engaged in simulations of Real Estate market with game theory based solutions, where I worked with professor Yunpeng Zhang from Houston Texas university. During this time, I advocated the blockchain technology for being used in real estate market by tokenizing assets to avoid inflations and rapid fluctuations of prices.
			<br>
Ahora mismo, I'm working on Spatial Data Science applications and techniques for analysing Otago forest Lidar data.

<br>
In my free time, if I find any, I flirt with 3D printers and get them work with different techniques. The task that I'm involved with is <em>Direct 3D printing</em> that helps print certain SDF functions directly without further triangulations, mehsings, or other modifications in between. This save practitioners time and energy and is able to print almost exact (up to a machine's accuracy) solid volumes without any approximations for stl exports.
